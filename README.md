# Soccer-stats
This is a quick android application that I have been working on as an assignment for a job interview.
## Assignment
The assignment was to create a sports score mobile application using an API
## Learning Experience
This application was great for a learning experience, in the week that I've worked on it I managed to learn more about:
* RecyclerView
* JSON File Parsing
* API requests
* Intents
* And most importantly learned to read the Documentation, honestly, I spend way too many hours reading through the API extensive documentation.
## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the open API library "http://www.football-data.org/"
