# Soccer-stats
Native Android application that serves as an API client for displaying
a curated list of soccer competitions.

## Architecture Patterns
> [Version 1.0](https://github.com/emeruvia/Soccer-Stats/tree/API-v1): provides the most basic implementation of the application, written in Java and AsyncTasks

> [Version 2.0](https://github.com/emeruvia/Soccer-Stats/tree/API-V2): Updated application, Java -> Kotlin, use retrofit instead of AsyncTasks, minor UI updates.

> Version 3.0 (WIP): Kotlin, MVVM architecture, Coroutines, Retrofit, etc.
